      "title": "War Thunder \"Air Superiority\" - Changelog",
      "description": "We’re ending 2023 in style with the awesome Air Superiority major update. Top-tier jets have been added to several nations, some of which include the F-15, the Su-27 and J-11, the Mirage 4000, plus the JAS39. We’ve introduced Rank VIII for ground vehicles, and subsequently new tanks: M1A2 SEP2, Leopard 2A7V, T-90M, VT-4A1, Strv 122B+ and Challenger 3 (TD)! The USA gets the brilliant USS Roanoke and a few other ships come in for other nations, while Volcano Valley is here for aircraft, set in the beautiful peninsula landscapes of Russia. The ability to use universal backups while in battle and tutorial missions for using aircraft missiles have also been added, and we’ve reworked all types of fire graphics for vehicles and burning buildings to make them look better in general."

      "title": "Update 2.33.0.105",
      "description": "Targeting pods and optics for high-ranked aircraft help to see ground targets and give the ability to launch at ranges that are comparable to the engagement ranges of SAMs. However, due to a bug in applying angular target sizes to the detection range through targeting optics, these ranges were noticeably smaller than they should have been for small targets. For example, for smaller vehicles such as the Swedish Lvrbv 701, the maximum range at which it could be detected in the targeting pod was about 8 km. After fixing this bug, its detection range will be over 20 km instead, and for larger targets even more."
