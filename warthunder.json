      "description": "From the summer of 1942, determined Axis forces launched an offensive into the Caucasus region in a bid to capture key locations. In 2 months, they managed to advance to Mozdok, but then hit a barrier — they were stopped from advancing further by the Soviets. From the beginning of 1943, Soviet troops squeezed out Axis forces from many occupied locations. Then, by October 9th 1943, all Axis troops were evacuated from the region, therefore full control of these locations were returned to the Soviets."
